A unit test setup using Angular2 starter 
(github: https://github.com/angular/quickstart0)
and integrating with Karma, Jasmine and PhantomJS.

Started with it as I was not able to find much of help related to
setting up unit testing for Angular 2.

Also, given the CI/CD environment that most of the applications
are in, it does make sense to use a headless browser like PhantomJS.
It doesn`t try to show test coverage report by opening chrome Window.

This project also outputs the coverage on the terminal in a nice 
tabular structure.
